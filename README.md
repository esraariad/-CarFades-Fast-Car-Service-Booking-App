# 🚗 CarFades – Fast Car Service Booking App

## 📱 Project Overview

**CarFades** is a fast and reliable mobile application for booking car-related services like detailing, tinting, oil change, and more. The app offers users the ability to browse available services, view service packages, book appointments, and make payments securely — all through a smooth and modern user interface.
